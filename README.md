### 🌱 About Me

- 🧠 **Curious & Driven:** Currently navigating my B.Tech in CSE, driven by a deep curiosity for not just how software works, but why people connect with it. My interest in psychology fuels my approach to building intuitive products.
- 🛠️ **Code as Craft:** To me, code isn’t just a job—it’s therapy, a distraction, and an endlessly satisfying puzzle to solve.
- 🧘 **Growth Mindset:** I'm not aiming to be a 10x developer; I'm just focused on being slightly better than I was yesterday.
