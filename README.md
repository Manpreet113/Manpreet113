### 🛠️ What I’m screwing around with (Tech Stack)

- **Languages I kinda know:**  
  `Python` | `C` | `JavaScript` (still wooing it)  
- **Next on my hit list:**  
  `C++`, `React`, `TypeScript`, `Web Dev`, `Linux`, `TailwindCSS`, `Git`  
- **Tools that keep me sane:**  
  `Vite` | `VS Code` | `Arch Linux (because why not suffer)` | `GitHub`

### 🚧 Currently Cooking (Projects & Chaos)

**[BrainDump](https://github.com/Manpreet113/BrainDump)**  
A messy second brain for messy first brains. Notes, todos, half-baked ideas — all thrown in one cozy chaos board.  
> Because I wanted to learn and there's no way to learning that's better than doing.

**[hyprL](https://github.com/Manpreet113/hyprL)**  
Custom Hyprland setup because... why have a normal desktop when you can rice your entire existence?  
> One-liner install because I realised it works:
 
> ⚠️ You must have arch installed even if barely booting.
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Manpreet113/hyprL/master/main/setup.sh)

### 🧠 The Lore (a.k.a About Me)

- Currently in the "confused but motivated" arc of my B.Tech CSE journey  
- Code isn’t just code — it’s therapy, distraction, and oddly satisfying when it compiles  
- Psychology nerd — I like understanding what makes people tick  
- Social battery = 15%, but I can write code and disappear  
- Not aiming to be a 10x developer, just trying to be slightly better than yesterday

### 🧾 Reality Check

> _“Don’t try to be a genius. Be consistent.”_  
> — Some random dude who clearly wasn’t sleep-deprived

### ⚠️ You’ve been warned

Expect:
- Scattered ideas and unpolished code  
- Commits that scream “I’ll clean this later” (I probably won’t)  
- Sarcastic comments, possibly written at 3AM  
- A sprinkle of “how did this even work?”
